# web3-blockchain

I hope you will check my proposal carefully.

My name is Jiro and I am from Japan, but I live in California. I am a senior full stack web developer with 10+ years of experience.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiro-kei-924b84226/

I would like to have a good collaboration with you for the long term. You will get paid extra income every month, but it will never interrupt your main business. 

Do you know https://upwork.com ? It is freelancing remote platform and there are many United State clients going to hire web developers in Upwork and there are good jobs called U.S.Only job. But I am not US person, most clients are a bit reluctant to work with Asian developers. So I am looking for a collaborator who will assist me a little. 

If you don't mind, I would like to use your upwork account on your laptop remotely. Maybe I could work with more than 100$ per hour.

I will share the revenue %30 of the income from account. 

I would like to get help the call support from you.

Of course we can collaborate other platform too such as LinkedIn.
